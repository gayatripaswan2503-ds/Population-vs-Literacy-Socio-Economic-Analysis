# 📊 Population vs Literacy Rate Analysis (India)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to study the relationship between **population growth, literacy rate, income, employment, health expenditure, and urbanization** across Indian states.  
The goal is to identify **socio-economic patterns** and understand how literacy and income influence overall state development.


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  


## 📂 Dataset Details
- State-wise socio-economic dataset (India)
- 800+ rows (synthetically structured for analysis practice)
- Key features include:
  - Population (2011 & 2021 – estimated)
  - Literacy rate (overall, male & female)
  - Per capita income
  - Employment rate
  - Rural population
  - Health expenditure
- Additional columns included for **data cleaning and preprocessing demonstration**


## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and handling of missing values
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Comparative analysis across regions and states
- Trend analysis using:
  - Bar charts
  - Line plots
  - Scatter plots
  - Heatmaps
- Correlation analysis between literacy, income, and development indicators


## 📈 Key Insights & Conclusions
- Literacy rates have improved across all states, with **Kerala and Goa** consistently ranking the highest.
- **Gender literacy gaps** remain significant in states such as **Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan**.
- **Income inequality** is prominent — **Goa** leads in per capita income, while **Bihar** remains the lowest.
- Urbanization trends are stronger in **South and West India**.
- States with **higher education spending** tend to show **better health outcomes**.
- Overall, **literacy growth and income levels** emerge as the strongest indicators of state development.


## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened skills in data cleaning and exploratory analysis
- Improved ability to visualize and interpret socio-economic data
- Gained practical experience in deriving insights from multi-variable datasets
- Developed a structured approach to real-world data analysis projects


## 📌 Project Use Case
This project demonstrates **EDA skills** relevant for:
- Data Analyst roles  
- MIS Executive roles  
- Entry-level analytics and reporting positions
